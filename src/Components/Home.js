                    <p>On July 7, 2017, we announced the formation of the Dane Sanctuary Coalition. Formed in partnership with Voces de la Frontera and Centro Hispano of Madison, Dane Sanctuary organizes congregations and organizations to provide physical sanctuary to our immigrant friends and neighbors who are at risk for deportation. We do this as part of the national New Sanctuary Movement. 
                    </p> 
                    <br></br>
                    <p>
                        The Dane Sanctuary Coalition has been created in response to immoral immigration policies that threaten families, instill fear in our communities, and violate the most basic ethical standards all our faith traditions teach â€“ that we are all created in the image of God, endowed with inherent worth and dignity, and deserving of a life free of violence and deprivation. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>The mission of the Dane Sanctuary Coalition states:</h2>
                    <p>Based on our shared faith commitments to social justice, we will assist vulnerable immigrant and refugee communities. We will do this, under the leadership of Voces de la Frontera and Centro Hispano, by providing and supporting physical sanctuary as needed, and by acting as a conduit for information, education, and trainings on other immigrant justice actions.</p>

                    <p>Thirty-six times, the Bible commands us to love the stranger in our midst. But these are not strangers among us. They are our friends, our neighbors, our co-workers. They sit beside us in class. They own businesses in our neighborhoods. They are part of the fabric of our community and we are richer for their presence among us.</p>
                    <p>As people of faith, we strive to bring to reality our vision of a world where every person is treated with dignity and respect, where their contributions to our society are valued, and where all can live together in freedom and safety.  This vision impels us to stand together in unity with our immigrant and refugee friends and neighbors, to offer our support and help, and to provide Sanctuary to those in need. We invite you to join us in this work!</p>
